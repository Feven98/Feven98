I am a software engineer with a BS in electrical and electronics technology and an experienced full-stack developer with different languages including JavaScript technologies(MERN Stack) and Django. I enjoy working with a team and troubleshooting and resolving technical issues. I am also eager to learn new things and challenge myself.
